<h2>Mitigating corporate information exposure on the web:</h2>


<div style="width:550px; margin:0 auto;">

<p>Information is vital for any corporation, without it their structure would crumble.
From this we can understand why it has always been, and always will be, extremely important to ensure that it is kept in safe hands, away from malicious behaviours.
This literature review will summarise my findings about how exposure of information occurs, and how it can be tackled effectively.</p>


<p>Interestingly, there seems to be a common cause regarding how the compromise of information arises.
Authors like Sanderson, Allen, and Densham all agree that human error plays an enormous role in the data breaches.
Sanderson (2011, p.10-12) expands on this idea by presenting a case study.
In his example, an IT administrator steals valuable information from a company, and proceeds by demanding a ransom fee.
This shows that the breaches are often caused by a failure within the workforce rather than from within the actual IT systems themselves.
The author states that he believes data loss is a business issue, rather than an IT one.</p>

<p> Densham (2015, p.5-8), on the other hand, in his article blames the lack of adequate training and briefing of the workforce rather than a failure of the actual workers.
The attacks have become much more personal, meaning that employees can easily fall in to the trap of compromising the whole organisation’s security.
The author expands on this by explaining that a simple, wellconstructed phishing email is able to penetrate well configured firewalls.
Therefore, this leaves not only the less IT-literate employees in a business most vulnerable, but also the senior, more experienced, security staff.
This all happens by clicking on a link or opening an attachment in a moment of distraction. </p>
<p> Allen’s (2013, p.12-14) paper reinforces the idea of failure which results from the complacency of the workforce, as he expresses the danger of not correctly following safety procedures.
These are put in place to ensure safety, however a simple lack of understanding their importance becomes fatal, as it may lead to a disregard for them.
This not only compromises the organisation’s data, but can also bring security risks to firm’s clients. The paper shows that over 160,000 social security numbers have been exposed from the Washington state court system.
Attacks like these, exposing sensitive information, cause a mistrust and loss in credibility for the organisations affected, which in the worst-case scenarios, can lead to a failure of small-scale organisations.</p>
<p> Knowing and understanding the origin of these breaches is possibly the most important step towards mitigating the information exposure.
With the added pressure from governments, whom fine large sums of money to corporations who fail to have necessary safety features, reducing exposure becomes extremely necessary.
Numerous approaches have been adopted to protect corporations from these beaches, because these attacks are becoming more sophisticated and complex in nature. </p>
<p> Sanderson proposes that the way the information is stored and discarded of is extremely important to prevent a breach.
The author stresses the importance of organisations to know who has access to the data and why they do. It is of the utmost importance that only specific groups of employees have access to it.
Furthermore, highly sensitive data should be stored with an even higher level of security, for example by being encrypted.
Once the data has outlived its purpose and usefulness, it must be discarded professionally, ideally by organisations who can provide certificates of destruction. </p>
<p> Densham contradicts Sanderson, by providing a different approach.
As the breaches are caused by human errors, the solution is to fix the human aspect rather than the technical aspect.
The author suggests that this can be done by creating a “sobering effect” from inside the organisations.
The key is to change mind sets in a way whereby staff are trained to expect a breach at any given moment.
However, a breach also does not mean that it is the end of the road for the company.
The author emphasises just how much of a problem this human error can be, stating that most breaches can go undetected for up to 240 days.
The correct approach is to provide higher quality of staff training, which will then ensure that the organisation’s safety procedures are adhered to. </p>
<p> Allen’s paper disagrees with the idea of focusing on internal improvements, as the author, with the use of statistics, explains that there is a shortage of workers.
The author shows that, in the 2013 (ISC)² Global Information Security Workplace Study, states that 56% of respondents believe that there is a shortage of staff.
As a result, we can conclude that it is nearly impossible to make adequate changes in a firm’s protocol and training, as there is a shortage of workers to carry out this task.
The organisations should instead focus on hiring enough skilled cybersecurity staff to start off with. They can then switch their focus towards training processes and protocols.
In addition, corporations should focus on the external cyber-attacks, as the majority of threats arise from outside of the corporation.
The author goes onto explain how organisations can do this, such as performing regular penetration tests, to ensure that the defence mechanisms are of a high standard.
He also suggests that there is a need for a stricter control on who has access to sensitive materials. Without these controls, there runs the risk of less experiences users accidentally leaving the firm vulnerable to a breach.</p>
<p> Overall, it is sensible to conclude that there are major safety concerns in all organisations.
The general public, as well as users of these organisation’s services, rely on large companies to keep their personal information confidential.
Ensuring that safety guidelines are met, information is kept protected and that workers are happy, are all practices that organisations must now follow, as the threats are becoming more intricately designed.
It has become necessary for corporations to be two steps ahead in the cybersecurity world. It sounds hard, if not impossible in theory, however the findings within my review, suggest that it may be possible to do so, if the correct procedures are undertaken. </p>
