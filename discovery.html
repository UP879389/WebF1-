<h2>  Week 2:Unit Prep </h2>
<h3> What did I do today?</h3>
<dl>
<dd>•I set up my own Virtual Machine.</dd>
<dd>•Had a first look at my coursework, which involves writing a literature review, and creating a website.</dd>
<dd>•Filled out a website award form.</dd>

<h3> What did I learn?</h3>
<dd>•In the practical, I learnt how to set up the Virtual Machine. As I had never used one before, it was a chance to learn about something new and develop new skils. This is essential in my upcoming weeks of studying, as I will use my VM in both database and website design.</dd>
<dd>•I also learnt what APA V6 refrencing is, and how to properly use it. This is a must as in my upcoming coursework (literature review) I will need to cite and reference academic journals. Furthermore, referencing will be a skill needed for all my future upcoming career, so it is vital that I become familiar with it. </dd>
<h3> What will I improve on? </h3>
<dd>• I will carry on using my VM, and practice with new commands. </dd>
<dd>• I will also ensure to fully understand how to acurately reference and cite, in order to be prepared and gain marks on my referencing for my Literature Review. </dd>

<h2>Week 3:Web Security</h2>
<h3> What did I do today? </h3>
<dd>•In today's practical, the task I had was to be carried out in a group.</dd>
<dd>•In the task we had to think of the information we generate on a day to day basis, and how this information could be categorised, based on how sensitive it is.</dd>
<dd>• We also had to think ahead into the near future, and how social media could use our findings to change their policies.</dd>

<h3> What did I learn?</h3>
<dd>• In the practical, I had the chance to learn about the various types of information we generate as individuals.</dd>
<dd> As we were all of similar ages in my group, I assumed that we would end up with the same ideas regarding the information we generate. To my surprsie it was not the case, as we were all able to come up with different ideas.</dd>

<h2>Week 4:Reviewing Literature</h2>
<h3>What did I do today?</h3>
<dd>•In the practical, I started off my first coursework: a Literature Review.</dd>
<dd>•I started off by researching what topics and areas I would discuss in my review. As cybersecurity is such a vast and complex topic, I had to skim through many academic journals and papers in order to find the ones I would be happy to use. As my aim is to write an interesting and engaging review.</dd>
<dd>•Once my research was making progress I had to make notes on what I was reading. In this way I will be able to select which arguments to use on this topic. In order for my review to be well written, I will need some contrasting arguments. In order to achieve that, my notes will be of great help when making points.</dd>
<h3>What did I learn today?</h3>
<dd>•As my research went on, I learnt more about how the security of our data is handled. This is of extreme importance as when I will write up my review I will have to understand the arguments the authors make.</dd>
<dd>•In addiiton, I learnt how to quickly read academic papers and make a decision on whether or not they will help me for my coursework. At first I was very confused on how I would write my review as I did not have a reading list to start off with, however once I got reading, the key terms helped me discover more journals and authors that I could reference.</dd>
<h3>What will I improve on?</h3>
<dd>•I will do more research on the mitigating of corporate exposure, as I am eager on having many different views on the issue.</dd>
<dd>•I will also create a mind map and find ways in which ideas can link together.</dd>

<h2>Week 5:Academic Writing</h2>
<h3>What did I do today?</h3>
<dd>•In today’s practical, the worksheet contained a set of tasks where I had to replace the existing phrases with new ones which were: formal, eloquent, objective and concise. This is what is expected of me in my upcoming literature review, which made it an essential exercise in order to achieve a top grade.</dd>
<h3>What did I learn today?</h3>
<dd>•As I have not written many essays in the past two years, today’s practical enabled me to enhance my literary skills. </dd>
<dd>•I learnt what cues are and how they can be used in writing, in order to make even the simplest of sentences appear much more formal.</dd>
